            <h2 id="about">About</h2>
            <p>A café is a type of restaurant which usually serves coffee and snacks. The term "café" comes from
                French, and means "coffee".</p>
            <p>You can read newspapers and magazines there, or chat with other customers about current topics. It
                is known as a place where information can be exchanged.</p>
            <p>A café is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop or tea shop in English, a café in French
                and a cafe in Italian. (Cafe/café is the spelling in English, French, Spanish etc. But "caffe" is
                how the Italian word for coffee is spelled in that language.) It shares some of the characteristics
                of a bar, and some of the characteristics of a restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria,
                which is a type of restaurant where customers can choose from many dishes on a serving line. In
                some countries, cafes more closely resemble restaurants, offering a range of hot meals, and
                possibly being licensed to serve alcohol. Most British cafes, however, do not sell alcohol.</p>
            <p>In the Netherlands, cannabis-selling cafés face an uncertain future under a planned new law banning
                smoking in public places. The cafés, which attract millions of tourists each year, allow customers
                to buy marijuana over the counter and openly smoke it. In the United States, donut shops are also
                popular places to drink coffee and hang out.</p>
            <p>A new type of café, known as the Internet café, was introduced in the 1990s. The spread of
                modern-style cafes to many places, urban and rural, went hand in hand with computers. Computers and
                Internet access in a contemporary atmosphere created a youthful, modern public space, compared to
                the traditional bars, or old-fashioned diners that they replaced. Nowadays, many cafés offer
                wireless Internet or have computers customers can use, just as they offer telephones and
                newspapers. You can order from your smartphone, tablet, or pretty much any other device on some
                websites, like Starbucks through a free app.</p>
